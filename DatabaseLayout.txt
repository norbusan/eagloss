Person
	id(name)
	hanzi
	pinyin
	notone		(pinyin without tone indication)
	other		(other possible names, in pinyin)
％ Field for names in other languages (other than Chinese, so not pinyin) now we want glossaries for different languages I guess we will need more fields, especially since some items have Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese names. 
	othernotone	(other possible names, in notone)
% We can forget about this one. Also in terms and books
	wadegiles	(???)
％ Wade Giles was the romanisation of choice for Chinese before pinyin and many Chinese classics are still better known abroad by their Wade Giles names, e.g the I Ching.
	description	(longer description about the person)
	index		(???)   
％ index is a hack to ensure that English names are ordered alphabetically by surname; do you think we need seperate fields for surname and forenames?
	inglossary	(what is this?)  
％ inglossary is a flag to say if the item will appear in the the glossary listing; if it is easy to do, it would be better to replace this with a list of keywords that can later be used to produce filtered lists, e.g. logic, pre-qin, japanese, etc.
